## Notes

For any project you must understand the following:
- How to scale the solution to a higher degree?
- How to make the solution highly available?
- How can you cost optimize the solution?
- How do you secure the solution?

If you use the AWS console, create a readme file and document the process 
to show how you create the resources.
